"""
This class is used for generating and synching body data gathered by the Arduino Watch to the AFNT App and the LocalDB (Incomplete).
Also gets the body data collected by the Arduino Watch from the csv file called `arduino.csv`. The following data is obtained from the csv file:
Heart rate (BPM), blood oxygen level (%), step count and body temperature (Â°C).
